**Overview:**
This project involves the development of a sentiment analysis report using Python to classify positive and negative comments efficiently. By utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the solution automates sentiment classification, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

**Features:**
Classifies comments as positive or negative using advanced NLP models.
Leverages pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for context-aware sentiment analysis.
Integrates data preprocessing with libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn.
Provides visual insights through Matplotlib for sentiment distribution.
Handles large datasets with Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation.
Saves results in structured formats (CSV/Excel) for easy sharing and further analysis.

**Libraries Used**
NLTK: For tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
BERT: For deep learning-based sentiment classification.
Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For feature extraction, training, and evaluation.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.

**Results**
Classification Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy through fine-tuned BERT.
Efficiency: Reduced manual time by over 60%, ensuring quicker insights.
Approval: Validated by comparing with human-labeled data.
